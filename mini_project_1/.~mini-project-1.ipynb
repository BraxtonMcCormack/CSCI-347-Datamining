    "This paper aims to deep dive into the analysis of the Student Performance database, which was provided by Paulo Cortez in 2014. Through real world data gathered through school reports and questionaires from two schools, this dataset seeks to understand how socioeconomic status contributes to high failure rates in Portugal. Cortez created two different datasets; one focuses on Mathematics and the other Portuguese. Our paper will focus on Mathematics dataset for this mini project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Including the three target variables, there are 33 total attributes with 16 numerical features and 17 categorical features. We opted for one-hot encoding beacuse the categorical variables are either mostly binary, which only has two categories, or nomial, which has no inherit order. Label encoding is preferred when there is a large number of categories and they are ordinal.\n",

This list includes variables like father and mother workday alcohol consumption, mother and father education, and  whether the student is in extra paid classes or is in extra-curricular activities. By analysising and predicting which students are more likely to fail,  methods that reduce student failure can be reasearched and applied to students in need.\n",
